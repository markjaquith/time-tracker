# Time Tracker 

Quick (and really rough) VS Code extension to do time tracking as you work on a VS Code workspace project.

Don't use this - I'm just playing around with VS Code extensions.

## Features

- Start timer and name your task
- View elapsed time and task name in the status bar
- Stop timer (writes task to `time-tracking.md`)
- Resumes in-progress timer if VS Code is restarted
- View time tracking log within VS Code

Starting/stopping the timer can be done via the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) or by using the status bar item.
